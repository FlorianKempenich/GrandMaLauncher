# GrandMaLauncher
Basic launcher for my grand mother ;)

## Wtf is this ?
Well basically don't really care to check it out ^_^ 
It's a private project that's been wrapped up in a couple of hours. I hosted it on github for simplicity.

If you do decide to check it out BEWARE : 
 - Lots of hard coded stuff
 - Poor logic
 - Non optimized drawables
 - Bad practices
 - No error check
 
Basically this project is everything you shouldn't do ^_^ But in my case I needed something quickly to accompany a christmas gift.
And it does the job pretty well. I might update it . . . but most likely no
